          <p>We first decided to test how well deep learning neural networks could perform on Region of Interest (ROI) images.</p>
          <p>We saw some great success, specifically with the binary classification task of sarcoma vs. carcinoma tumors on a small amount of images.</p>
          <p>As a result, we continued our work into multiclass classification as well, looking at different subtypes of carcinoma.</p>

          <p>This project attempts to leverage the power of deep learning neural networks into a web platform that can be used by pathologists for a quick screening.</p>
          <p>The weights utilized for this project were initially trained from data from the National Cancer Institute's <a href="https://pdmr.cancer.gov/" id="PDMRLink">Patient Derived Models Repository</a>, but we hope to continue training our platform with more data in the near future.</p>
